## Overview

MaBourse is a production-grade, full-stack scholarship management platform that helps students discover, filter, and apply for scholarships while providing administrators with advanced tools for managing listings, users, communications, and campaigns.

The platform evolved from an early prototype into a **secure, enterprise-capable system** through a multi-phase process:

* Database migration (file ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí Sequelize ‚Üí PostgreSQL)
* Authentication hardening (JWT, secure cookies, session DB tracking)
* Security foundations (OWASP compliance, event logging, anomaly detection)
* Enterprise-level modernization (admin portal redesign, CI readiness, production audits)

This repository is the **public showcase**. The **codebase is intentionally private**, but this README + demo are designed for reviewers (professors, supervisors, recruiters) to evaluate the project‚Äôs technical depth and production readiness.

## Demo (9 minutes)

üì∫ **Watch the 9-minute walkthrough demo**:

* Public portal: browsing, search, filters, details, subscriptions
* Admin portal: dashboard, CRUD, bulk import/export, messaging, analytics, security monitoring

**Demo file**: `demo.mp4` (included here)
**External link**: `REPLACE_WITH_UNLISTED_YOUTUBE_OR_REPO_DEMO_LINK`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Demo Credentials Note**: The admin login shown (`admin123@gmail.com`) is a **placeholder email** used for demonstration only.
> The password is masked. Real production credentials are **different, secured, and never exposed** in this repository or video.

## Why this project matters

* üåç Bridges the **information gap** for students worldwide seeking scholarships (multi-language: English, French, Arabic with RTL support).
* üîß Captures **real-world engineering complexity**: relational database schema, secure auth, audit logging, anomaly detection, bulk operations.
* üöÄ Demonstrates the **full lifecycle** of building a production system: prototyping, migrations, remediation, testing, audits, deployment planning.

---

## Highlights & Achievements

* ‚úÖ **Production-ready** ‚Äî 95%+ readiness across audits, validated via multiple technical reviews.
* ‚úÖ **Enterprise security** ‚Äî 2FA (TOTP), device trust, ML anomaly detection, CSP, structured logging.
* ‚úÖ **Performance** ‚Äî APIs <200 ms avg, DB queries <100 ms avg, frontend load <3s.
* ‚úÖ **Modernized admin portal** ‚Äî rebuilt with Ant Design, consolidated backend, bulk imports.
* ‚úÖ **Database migration** ‚Äî legacy ‚Üí PostgreSQL with clean schema & constraints.
* ‚úÖ **Operational proof** ‚Äî system status reports confirm *All systems operational*.

## Database & schema overview

Core schema (simplified, PostgreSQL):

```prisma
model Scholarship {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String
  level       String?
  country     String?
  deadline    DateTime
  thumbnail   String?
  createdBy   Int
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

**Security tables**: `security_events`, `trusted_devices`, `admin_sessions`, `admin_password_history`, `api_keys`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on data**: All records in the database are **sample/fake data created for development and testing only**.
> No real student, institutional, or sensitive data is included.

---

## Security & compliance

* Full OWASP Top 10 coverage (XSS, CSRF, SQLi, SSRF, etc.).
* GDPR-aware data handling: consent, export, delete.
* Strong password policy (bcrypt + history enforcement).
* Security headers: CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
* Configurable environment-specific CSP violation reporting.

---

## Production readiness & performance

* **Audit score**: 95%+ security validation pass.
* **API latency**: <200 ms avg.
* **DB queries**: <100 ms avg.
* **Frontend load**: <3s with optimized builds.

**Deployment checklist** includes:

* Env templates & secret mgmt.
* DB migration & backup procedures.
* HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, CDN.
* Monitoring + APM integration.

---

## Challenges, remediation & lessons learned

* **Admin portal fragmentation** ‚Üí unified with Ant Design + PostgreSQL.
* **Frontend/backend integration issues** ‚Üí fixed via proxy middleware + CORS credentials.
* **Newsletter legacy conflict** ‚Üí replaced file-based with DB-backed subscriber mgmt.

Full remediation steps are detailed in `/docs` with before/after evidence.
